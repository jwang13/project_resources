</h3>

<p>After failed pleas to private equity firms for buyout and to the German government for bailout money, the massive drugstore chain Schlecker shut its doors in 2012. In total, 3200 stores were shut down and 13,200 employees lost their jobs, even though the workers were willing to take pay cuts to help the company stay afloat. The company, which was founded in 1975 and once oversaw a roster of over 14,000 stores and 50,000 employees and posted annual sales of over 7 billion euros, was forced to declare bankruptcy due to “business problems” (Dw.com).

  This case study is an example of how fickle the brick and mortar drugstore business can be. If capital is not deployed strategically, or inventory is not managed well, optimal sales will not be reached, and the store will lose money. Therefore, it is extremely important to be able to accurately predict sales so that managers can be best equipped to optimize store performance in advance.

Today, Rossmann is the largest drugstore in Germany. Rossmann store managers are responsible for predicting their daily sales for up to 6 weeks in advance. This is a difficult problem, as there are so many factors that can influence sales.

<p> There have been a number of groups who have looked into this problem. After reading the current literature on Rossmann sales, we found that existing papers featured the following models: Linear Regression, (Xgboost) Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Regression, Hidden Markov Model, Recurrent Neural Networks and Support Vector Regression. The best approaches across these paper, in terms of the Root Mean Square Percentage Error (or RMSPE) metric, were Support Vector Regression (Lin et. al) and Gradient Boosting regression model (Knott et. al.).

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background + Data Cleaning</h3>

<p> We were given sales data for 1115 Rossmann drugstores over a time period of two years. After exploring the data, we found that for 184 days in the two year period, 180 stores were temporarily closed for refurbishment. Thus, in order to build a model, we needed to fill in the data for these stores when they were closed. The parameters in the given dataset were Store (ID of store), DayOFWeek (M, T, W, T, F, S, S), Date (Month-Date-Year), Sales (in dollars), Customers (number of customers), Open (if the store was open or closed that day), Promo (if the store was holding a promotion), StateHoliday (if the day was a state holiday), SchoolHoliday (if the day was a school holiday). Our initial model for this step to fill in the missin dat was to use KNN (such as estimating sales using the sales of the open stores on that date, or data from that specific store using the closest dates) and Logistic Regression (converting the date timestamps into integers in order to model the time series data). Ultimately, due to constraints on computing power (in the case of KNN) and a goal of maximizing accuracy, we decided to interpolate and fill in the missing data in the following manner: 1) For Sales and Customers data, we take the median value across other data points with similar or matching values for the DayOfWeek, Promo, and Open predictors. 2) For binary predictors such as StateHoliday or SchoolHoliday, we inpute whatever the majority vote across all stores for that day was.

In the image above, the left hand image shows the number of stores open per day, and the 184 day period where a fraction of the stores were closed for refurbishment is evident. On the right is the date vs. sales graph for one of the stores that underwent reburbishment (Store 13), and we can see the sharp drop in the graph during that period.

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
